    "Accelerating Waveplot"?
P 1:
    What is waveplot?
        - Distribute electron density on grid.
            -> Compute several STOs accross discretised grid
            Uses:
                -> Visualisation
            Future:
                -> Library, interface between DFTB+ and Octopus
Approaches:
    Pointwise:
    -> For every grid point, sum all contributions of atoms.
    -> Embarassingly parallel, e.g. omp gpu parallelisation
    Stencil/ Cached:
    -> Avoid recalculating orbitals.
    -> Calculate once, and store in cache
    -> Read orbital, and "stamp" onto output grid.
    -> Grid distance aligned such that memory (in 1d) contiguous

    -> Interpolated (trilinear, on gpu)
    -> Trilinear interpolation (gpu!)



System:
    - Tiny (H)
    - Small (H20)
    - C60
    - Medium (125 H2O)
    - Large (1000 H2O)



System (e.g. 64 scattered H2O molecules)
50A x 50A x 50A cube at 100x100x100 points, 0.5A point separation

Runtime graph: -1 omp parallel, 0 exact pointwise, 1... subdivision Factor

Accuracy:
Expected charge, Diff


Summary
    - Pointwise implementation wins
    - GPU acceleration is key
