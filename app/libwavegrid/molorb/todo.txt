Currently:
1. To create total density superposition, waveplot requests all wave functions and then adds them later.
This is memory inefficient, and we would prefer to accumulate in place.
Todo:
    Look into what the 'atomdens' calculation does.

2. Complex support is missing.

3. Library interface should be improved. (streamlined)

4. If compiled with cuda support, the CPU OMP code is not available. For testing / debugging, having a switch to enable it could be useful to avoud rebuilding.
